## oplink
[__oplink__](https://opl.ink) was made to help computer science graduates connect with relevant entry-level jobs by filtering out hundreds of fluff from other job boards.

ðŸ”¹ **200+** new computer science jobs daily

ðŸ”¹ Filters out **100+** unrelated job postings daily

ðŸ”¹ **Search** by job title, company, and location

ðŸ”¹ Shows only the **newest** job postings from the past week

ðŸ”¹ **Sort** results by company, title, location, or time posted

This repo contains the source code for the web application and not for the scraping script.

## What's being filtered?

Currently the filter targets the following:

ðŸ”¹ **Unrelated job postings**.  Real examples that I've seen include: nurse, psychologist, janitor, doctor, cashier, resort worker.

ðŸ”¹ **Third-party job boards** that repost old jobs, presenting them as new.

ðŸ”¹ Companies that **repost the same job posting** in every location when the actual job requires relocation out-of-state.
