## oplink
[__oplink__](https://opl.ink) was made to help computer science graduates connect with relevant entry-level jobs by filtering out hundreds of fluff from other job boards.

🔹 200+ new computer science jobs daily

🔹 Filters out 100+ unrelated job postings daily

🔹 Search by job title, company, and location

🔹 Shows only job postings from the past week

This repo contains the source code for the web application and not for the scraping script.
